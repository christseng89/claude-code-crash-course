I want you to help me come up with a spec for a NEW web application that I'm going to  build. So the NEW web application is going to be a marketplace displaying all of the hooks that are available. So it's going to display lots of cards and each card is going to be a link to a GitHub repository with a different Claude Code hook to help us in our developer workflows.

I want you to think harder and I don't want to display it in a carousel but I want to display lots of cards in the homepage. And you missed lots of hook can be after generation for example.
